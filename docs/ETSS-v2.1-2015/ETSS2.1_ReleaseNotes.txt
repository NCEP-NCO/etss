V1.0.0 - WCOSS Transition --- by Arthur Taylor, Oct 11, 2012
         modified model to run on WCOSS
v1.5.0 - Implemented on Oct.15, 2014
         a) Using GRIB2 0.5 degree GFS data instead of GRIB1 1 degree GFS data
         b) Bug fix for wind control window for Arctic basin
         c) Additional output of 2.5 km CONUS grids (requiring a new mask file)
         d) Additional output of 3 km Alaska grids (requiring a new mask file)
         e) Correcting the Alaska mask files in the south Bering Sea
v2.0.0 - Implemented on May 19, 2015
         a) Re-introducing the inundation algorithm based on surge
         b) For the East and Gulf of Mexico coastlines, nesting the tropical
            and Extra-Tropical computational grids to leverage the finer 
            overland details contained within tropical grids
         c) ETSS post processing is being introduced to the operational
            environment to create SHEF-encoded water level guidance for River
            Forecast Centers
         d) ETSS post processing now uses NCEP's BUFR tanks (as opposed to web
            scraping) for observations
v2.1.0 - Code handoff #1 on June 30, 2015
       - Target Implementation date Sep 8, 2015
         a) Creating a new Bering-Beaufort-Chukchi Sea (eBBC) Alaska basin to
            Resolve a problem with water flowing from one basin to another 
            through the Bering Strait.
         b) Determine best wind drag coefficient to use for eBBC
         c) Re-introducing the inundation algorithm based on surge and tide
         d) Provide overland guidance based on surge and tide for all U.S
            coastlines, which include tidal forcing for all domains
         e) Correct the SHEF encoding to use MLLW instead of MHHW as a
            vertical datum, and incorporate more stations

Input data changes: None

Output changes:
         Additional output of surge+tide and tideOnly on 625m CONUS grids 
             (requiring a new mask file)
         Additional output of surge+tide on 2.5/3 km CONUS/Alaska grids
         Additional station output of surge+tide

Computational resource information:
         Number of CPU: Increase to 14 CPU (from 6 CPU)
         Memory: Increase to 1600 MB / CPU (from 600 MB)
         Serial/Parallel runs: 14 independent scripts run in parallel
         Run Time: 32 minutes (from 35 minutes)
         Disk space required: 
             1.0 Gig for disseminated data
             17.0G per cycle for working folder folder
         How often: 4 cycle per day

Dependencies: 
         (a) GRIB2 library in /nwprod/lib, 
         (b) /nwprod/util/exec/tocgrib2, 
         (c) tocgrib2super

Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under prod/para/test environments: 
         A few weeks

Preimplementation testing requirements:
	 /dev/runETSS.sh, /dev/runPost_ETSS.sh and /dev/runETSS_gempak.sh 
             should be tested as part of this implementation

Does this change require a 30-day evaluation? Likely
         The suggested evaluators: AK-HQ, AK-WFOs, MDL, OPC

Include dissemination info
	 Where should this output be sent? SBN
	 Primary users: WFO and OPC
	 Archive to HPSS
	 Retention length: Few years
	 List which output files should be archived: 
         a) The GRIB files (etss.t${cyc}z*.grib2)
         b) Station output files (mdlsurge.${cyc}* and etss.t${cyc}z*.txt)
         c) Shef and CSV files (etss.t${cyc}z*.shef_tar and etss.t${cyc}z*.csv_tar)
