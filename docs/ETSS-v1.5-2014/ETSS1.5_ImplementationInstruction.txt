1.	Check out ETSS1.5 from the repository:
	cd to your working directory
	svn co https://collaborate3.nws.noaa.gov/svn/etss/gfs_stormsurge/trunk/ etss1.5
2.	Build and Install the ETSS1.5 codes
	$ cd etss1.5/sorc
	$ make install
3.	Run the model
	$ cd ../
	$ ./runETSS.sh YYYYMMDD XX
where:	YYYYMMDD is date (e.g 20140520),
        XX is cycle (00, 06, 12, 18)
This does the following:
1.	Copies input data from /com to the etss1.5/work/com test directory structure.
2.	Copies production’s current answers from /pcom and /com to etss1.5/work/pcom and /com for comparsion.
3.	Runs etss1.5/myEcf/jgfs_stormsurge.ecf to run the model.
	Example: run the model for May 20, 2014 00Z cycle:
	$ ./runETSS.sh 20140520 00
	(Caution:You need make sure the GFS wind output data is available before you run the ETSS model. MDL found that the GFS output is delayed by between 4 to 5 hours, so we assume a 4 hours 50 minutes delay)
4.	Compare the following to validate the ETSS 1.5 model runs...
	The ETSS1.5 model low resolution output grids (5 km CONUS and 6 km for AK) results are saved in GRIB2 format here for direct comparison with the ETSS1.0 model results:
	etss1.5/work/pcom/gfs/grib2.mdlsurgegrid.${cyc}${area}.gfs_stormsurge_${cyc}
	The operational ETSS1.0 model results are here:
	etss1.5/work/pcom/ans/grib2.mdlsurgegrid.${cyc}${area}.gfs_stormsurge_${cyc}
	The ETSS1.5 model high resolution output grids (2.5 km CONUS and 3 km for AK) results are also saved in GRIB2 format in the same folder as the low resolution output:
	etss1.5/work/pcom/gfs/grib2.mdlsurgegrid.2.5km.${cyc}con.gfs_stormsurge_${cyc}
	etss1.5/work/pcom/gfs/grib2.mdlsurgegrid.3km.${cyc}ala.gfs_stormsurge_${cyc}
5.	Within the working folder (etss1.5/work/tmp/gfs_stormsurge_${cyc}.{jobid}) these files are:
	grib2.mdlsurgegrid.${cyc}${area}
	grib2.mdlsurgegrid.2.5km.${cyc}con
	grib2.mdlsurgegrid.3km.${cyc}ala
