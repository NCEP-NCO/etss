	Input data changes
	Using GRIB2 GFS data instead of GRIB1
	0.5 degree GFS data instead of 1 degree
	bug fix for wind control window for Arctic basin
	GRIB2 library instead of using GRIB1 library located in /nwprod/lib
	Interpolate higher resolution (0.5 degree) GFS data to ETSS grid
	Output changes
	Additional output of 2.5 km CONUS grids (requiring a new mask file)
	Additional output of 3 km Alaska grids (requiring a new mask file)
	Correcting the Alaska mask files in the south Bering Sea
	Computational resource information:
	Number of CPU: <No Change> (2 CPU)
	Memory: Increase to 200 MB / CPU (from 100 MB)
	Serial/Parallel runs: 2 independent scripts run in parallel
	Run Time: 4-6 minutes
	Disk space required: 1.0 Gig for disseminated data (5.0G per cycle for working folder folder (ETSS1.5/work/tmp/)
	How often: 4 cycle per day
	Dependencies: (a) GRIB2 library in /nwprod/lib, (b) /nwprod/util/exec/tocgrib2
	Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under prod/para/test environments: A few weeks.
	Preimplementation testing requirements
	runETSS.sh should be tested as part of this implementation
	Does this change require a 30-day evaluation?  Unlikely
	The suggested evaluators: MDL, OPC, NHC, WFOs
	Include dissemination info
	Where should this output be sent? SBN
	Primary users: WFO and OPC
	Archive to HPSS
	Retention length: Few years
	List which output files should be archived: The GRIB files (grib2.mdlsurgegrid*)
