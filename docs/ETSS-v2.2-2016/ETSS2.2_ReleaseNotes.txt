         modified model to run on WCOSS
v1.5.0 - Implemented on Oct.15, 2014
         a) Using GRIB2 0.5 degree GFS data instead of GRIB1 1 degree GFS data
         b) Bug fix for wind control window for Arctic basin
         c) Additional output of 2.5 km CONUS grids (requiring a new mask file)
         d) Additional output of 3 km Alaska grids (requiring a new mask file)
         e) Correcting the Alaska mask files in the south Bering Sea
v2.0.0 - Implemented on May 19, 2015
         a) Re-introducing the inundation algorithm based on surge
         b) For the East and Gulf of Mexico coastlines, nesting the tropical
            and Extra-Tropical computational grids to leverage the finer 
            overland details contained within tropical grids
         c) ETSS post processing is being introduced to the operational
            environment to create SHEF-encoded water level guidance for River
            Forecast Centers
         d) ETSS post processing now uses NCEP's BUFR tanks (as opposed to web
            scraping) for observations
v2.1.0 - Implemented on November 3, 2015
         a) Creating a new Bering-Beaufort-Chukchi Sea (eBBC) Alaska basin to
            Resolve a problem with water flowing from one basin to another 
            through the Bering Strait.
         b) Determine best wind drag coefficient to use for eBBC
         c) Re-introducing the inundation algorithm based on surge and tide
         d) Provide overland guidance based on surge and tide for all U.S
            coastlines, which include tidal forcing for all domains
         e) Correct the SHEF encoding to use MLLW instead of MHHW as a
            vertical datum, and incorporate more stations
v2.2.0 - Code handoff #1 on February 29, 2017
       - Target Implementation date June 06, 2017
         a) Create a single basin with overland information that covers 
            Gulf of AK and West Coast
         b) Create a new Tide version to resolve tide phase shift in CD2, ETP3 and AP3
         c) Removed the reported storm surge 'wiggle' for the East Coast and  Gulf of 
            Mexico in version 2.1
         d) Experimentally generate max surge + tide above NAVD88 for 
            0 ~ 102 hours
         e) Extend forecast from 96 to 102 hours (to match P-Surge 2.6 (2016))
         f) Migrate to Cray
         g) Discontinue (a) 5.0 km CONUS and (b) 6.0 km AK grids as AWIPS 
            (16.1.1; Dec 15, 2015) will no longer need
         h) General Enhancements / Bug fixes (-check bounds IT test, improve
            merge mask, make adjustments to the CSV files so they are 
            self-describing and remove a bug in the linear interpolation for
            the post-processing codes)
           
Input data changes: None

Output changes:
         Extend output from 96 to 102 hours for gridded and text products
         Additional output of maximum Surge + Tide above NAVD88 for 0-102 hours
             on CONUS grids (2.5km and 625m) and Alaska grids (3km) 
         Add WMO headers to get gridded data into AWIPS 
             (surge+tide on CONUS 2.5km/625m and Alaska 3km grids, 
              TideOnly on CONUS 625m grid) 
         Discontinue (a) 5.0 km CONUS and (b) 6.0 km AK grids                    

Computational resource information:
         Number of CPU: Increase to 14 CPU (No change)
         Memory: Increase to 1600 MB / CPU (No change)
         Serial/Parallel runs: 14 independent scripts run in parallel
         Run Time: 28 minutes (from 37 minutes)
         Disk space required: 
             1.0 Gig for disseminated data
             17.0G per cycle for working folder folder
         How often: 4 cycle per day

Dependencies: 
         (a) GRIB2 library in /nwprod/lib, 
         (b) /nwprod/util/exec/tocgrib2, 
         (c) tocgrib2super

Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under prod/para/test environments: 
         A few weeks

Preimplementation testing requirements:
	 /dev/runETSS.sh, /dev/runPost_ETSS.sh and /dev/runETSS_gempak.sh 
             should be tested as part of this implementation

Does this change require a 30-day evaluation? Likely
         The suggested evaluators: AK-HQ, AK-WFOs, MDL, OPC

Include dissemination info
	 Where should this output be sent? SBN
	 Primary users: WFO and OPC
	 Archive to HPSS
	 Retention length: Few years
	 List which output files should be archived: 
         a) The GRIB files (etss.t${cyc}z*.grib2)
         b) Station output files (mdlsurge.${cyc}* and etss.t${cyc}z*.txt)
         c) Shef and CSV files (etss.t${cyc}z*.shef_tar and etss.t${cyc}z*.csv_tar)
